This project is a simple representation of how mnist can be applied using tkinter app. The steps for the project are given below:

Step1: Make a model
	-- In this step, we take the datasets from tensorflow_datasets and build our model using deep learning techniques.
	-- Refer to mnist_makingmodel.ipynb for the step.

Step2: Save the model
	-- The created model is then saved in google drive and to the local machine.
	-- Refer to mnist model folder to view the saved model.

Step3: Create a tkinter app
	-- This is the final step where we create a tkinter app which predicts the digit drawn on the canvas of the app.
	-- Since, we do not want the cmd prompt to open with the app, we use .pyw extension to our file.
	-- Refer to mnist.pyw for the step.

In this way, mnist project can be implemented using tkinter app. Please refer to the screenshots folder to view the result of the project.
